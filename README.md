# Echo-Eyes


## ~ THE INNOV∞ORS

We tried to create a gateway for the visually impaired to independence, knowledge, and unlimited potential for the visually impaired. <br>
Our project will remove visual barriers by enabling users to consume educational material being presented by screen sharing. <br>
We should envision a solution that can enable visually impaired in performing their day today activities effectively in a virtual setting. <br>
A student should be enabled to consume the educational material that’s being presented using any screen sharing softwarethat’s being presented in a virtual setting.
<br><br>

For setting up the environment for the EchoEyes application:

Step1: Open Powershell/Command Prompt. <br><br>
Step2: Install the following libraries using the command provided. <br><br>
`pip install pyautogui`<br><br>
`pip install pytesseract`<br><br>
`pip install wxpython`<br><br>
`pip install pyttsx3`<br><br>
